## My process

- I had to manually set a positioning for each choice, resulting in multiple spaghetti code in the CSS. Took me a long time to figure out I had to it this way, but very easy to implemenet. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The <template> can really be handy. The CSS styling was harder than the whole JavaScript, though I took a lot more time coding in JavaScript. 

### Continued development

- I added my own twist of animations, though it's a bit clunky. Hopefully, it can be buttersmooth in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Pulse Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtggx2rswKY&) - This pulse animation came in quite handy. A very good solution to a feature that I cannot begin to think of an approach.

- [Asaeneh's 30 Day of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript) - Asaeneh's guide to JavaScript.
